# Module 2 - Lab 1 - Exercise 1 - Deploy Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

## Lab scenario

![Lab overview.](../Media/SC-200-Lab_Diagrams_Mod2_L1_Ex1.png)

You are a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that is implementing Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Your manager plans to onboard a few devices to provide insight into required changes to the Security Operations (SecOps) team response procedures.

You start by initializing the Defender for Endpoint environment. Next, you onboard the initial devices for your deployment by running the onboarding script on the devices. You configure security for the environment. Lastly, you create Device groups and assign the appropriate devices.

>**Important:**  The lab Virtual Machines are used through different modules. SAVE your virtual machines. If you exit the lab without saving, you will be required to re-run some configurations again.

>**Note:** Make sure you have completed successfully Task 3 of the previous module.


### Task 1: Initialize Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

In this task, you will perform the initialization of the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint portal.

1. Log in to WIN1 virtual machine as Admin with the password: **Pa55w.rd**.  

1. If you are not already at the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, start the Microsoft Edge browser.

1. In the Edge browser, go to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal at (https://security.microsoft.com).

1. In the **Sign in** dialog box, copy, and paste in the tenant Email account for the admin username provided by your lab hosting provider and then select **Next**.

1. In the **Enter password** dialog box, copy, and paste in the admin's tenant password provided by your lab hosting provider and then select **Sign in**.

1. On the **Microsoft 365 Defender** portal, from the navigation menu, select **Settings** from the left.

1. On the **Settings** page select **Device discovery**. 

    >**Note:** If you do not see the **Device discovery** option under **Settings**, logout by selecting the top-right circle with your account initials and select **Sign out**. Other options that you might want to try is to refresh the page with Ctrl+F5 or open the page InPrivate. Login again with the **Tenant Email** credentials.

1. In Discovery setup make sure **Standard discovery (recommended)** is selected. **Hint:** If you do not see the option, refresh the page.


### Task 2: Onboard a Device.

In this task, you will onboard a device to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint using an onboarding script.

1. If you are not already at the Microsoft 365 Defender portal in your browser, start the Microsoft Edge browser and go to (https://security.microsoft.com) and login with the **Tenant Email** credentials.

1. Select **Settings** from the left menu bar, then from the Settings page select **Endpoints**.

1. Select **Onboarding** in the Device management section.
