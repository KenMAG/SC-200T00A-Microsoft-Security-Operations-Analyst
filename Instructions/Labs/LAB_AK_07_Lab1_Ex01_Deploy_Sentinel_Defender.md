# Learning Path 7 - Lab 1 - Exercise 1 - Configure your Microsoft Sentinel environment

## Lab scenario

You're a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that implemented Microsoft Sentinel. You need to understand the configuration of the Microsoft Sentinel environment to ensure it meets the company requirements to minimize cost, meet compliance regulations, and provide the most manageable environment for your security team to perform their daily job responsibilities.

>**Important:** The lab exercises for Learning Path #7 are in a *standalone* environment. If you exit the lab before completing it, you will be required to re-run the configurations again.

### Estimated time to complete this lab: 30 minutes

### Optional task - Connect Microsoft Sentinel to Microsoft Defender XDR

To understand how Microsoft Sentinel is onboarded to Microsoft Defender XDR, you can perform the instructions for this simulated exercise - **[Connect Microsoft Sentinel to Defender XDR](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/integrate-microsoft-defender-xdr-with-microsoft-sentinel/simulation-exercise-deploy-sentinel-to-defender)**.

### Task 1 - Explore Microsoft Sentinel settings in Defender XDR
